    Import numpy with the alias np.
    Create two DataFrames: one that holds the rows of food_consumption for 'Belgium' and another that holds rows for 'USA'. Call these be_consumption and usa_consumption.
    Calculate the mean and median of kilograms of food consumed per person per year for both countries.


Solution:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import numpy with alias np
import numpy as np

# Filter for Belgium
be_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'Belgium']

# Filter for USA
usa_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'USA']

# Calculate mean and median consumption in Belgium
print(np.mean(be_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(be_consumption['consumption']))

# Calculate mean and median consumption in USA
print(np.mean(usa_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(usa_consumption['consumption']))
